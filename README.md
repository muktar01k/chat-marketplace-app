# Chat App + Marketplace

## Vision

The **Chat App + Marketplace** project aims to create an integrated platform where users can **chat in real-time** and simultaneously engage in **buying and selling products** in an online marketplace. This combination of a social interaction space and a marketplace is designed to allow individuals to interact with each other, build communities, and conduct transactions in one seamless environment.

The app will provide the following key features:
- **Real-time messaging** for individuals and groups.
- A **Marketplace** where users can create listings for products and interact with potential buyers.
- **User Profiles** where users can track their transactions, sales, and messages.
- A flexible and intuitive **UI/UX** for a friendly user experience.
  
## Project Purpose
This platform is being built to bridge the gap between social interaction and commerce. It gives users the tools they need to connect with others, find products they’re looking for, and even sell their own products without the need for separate apps.

### Key Goals:
- To make a social space where people can engage in conversations around the products they want to buy or sell.
- To create an intuitive system where users don’t have to switch between different apps to communicate and manage their transactions.
- To build a system that will scale to accommodate thousands of users and transactions.
